On the top of this starter project two different features were implemented. This app provides two different options for dice roll: 
  
  1. TOUCH the dice.
  2. SHAKE the phone.
 
  
The shake feature was implemented by using the shake package. For more information visit https://pub.dev/packages/shake .
