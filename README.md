# Shake-the-Dice

A simple flutter app that rolls the dice on SHAKE or TOUCH.

The starter project was taken from https://github.com/londonappbrewery/dicee-flutter . This starter project only consists of plain scaffold and dice images. After importing the starter project, different features were implemented for dice roll.

This app provides two different options for dice roll: 
  1) Touch the dice.
  2) Shake the phone.
  
The shake feature was implemented by using the shake package. For more information visit https://pub.dev/packages/shake .
