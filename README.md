On the top of this starter project two different features were implemented. This app provides two different options for dice roll: 
  
  1. TOUCH the dice.
  2. SHAKE the phone.

The device will also VIBRATE on every dice roll.  
  
The shake feature was implemented by using the shake package. For more information visit https://pub.dev/packages/shake .

The vibrate feature was implemented using the vibration package. For more information visit https://pub.dev/packages/vibration .
